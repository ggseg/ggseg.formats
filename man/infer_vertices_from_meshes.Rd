\title{Infer vertex indices by matching mesh coordinates to brain surface}
\usage{
infer_vertices_from_meshes(atlas_3d, surface = "inflated", brain_meshes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{atlas_3d}{A \code{ggseg3d_atlas} with mesh data.}

\item{surface}{Which surface to match against (default \code{"inflated"}).}

\item{brain_meshes}{Brain mesh data to match against. If NULL, uses the
internal inflated mesh. Supports both \code{list(lh = ..., rh = ...)} and
\code{list(lh_inflated = ..., ...)} formats.}
}
\value{
Named list of integer vertex indices (0-based) keyed by label,
or NULL if brain_meshes unavailable.
}
\description{
Hash-based O(n+m) matching that rounds coordinates to 4 decimal places
and uses named vector lookup. Interpolated triangulation vertices that
don't match exactly are silently skipped.
